      "summary": "Set in the fictitious town of Sylvan, South Carolina, in 1964, The Secret Life of Bees tells the story of a 14-year-old white girl, Lily Melissa Owens, whose life has been shaped around the blurred memory of the afternoon her mother was killed. She lives in a house with her abusive father, whom she refers to as T.",

          {"firstReview": "I confess to being a little hesitant going into this book. It is, after all, that most cliched and irritating of literati faves: a coming-of-age story set in the American South. Lily, a motherless 14-year-old girl lives with her bigoted abusive father on a peach farm in South Carolina. Her goals involve befriending black people and finding information about her long-dead mother. Just summarizing this thing inspires the eye-rolling."},
          {"secondReview": "The Secret Life of Bees is a lovely tale. It tells of Lily, a South Carolina 14 year old. She lives, unhappily, with her crusty father T. Ray and Rosaleen, the woman who raised her after her mother died when Lily was 4. It is a coming of age tale set against the civil rights issues of the early 60â€™s. It is certainly no coincidence that Lily (as in white) spends most of the book in the company of earth-mother black people. "},
          {"thirdReview": "A coming-to-age novel set in South Carolina at the height of desegregation. Lily is a lovable pre-teen who'd grown up believing she killed her mother (accidentally) and is trying to escape a brutal, abusive father. Filled with a cast of eccentric characters, Lily runs away with Rosaleen, a black servant, and finds herself in a beekeeper's sanctuary, where secrets come spilling out of the closet for a cymbal-clashing ending."}

      "summary": "1984 is a dystopian novella by George Orwell published in 1949, which follows the life of Winston Smith, a low ranking member of 'the Party', who is frustrated by the omnipresent eyes of the party, and its ominous ruler Big Brother. 'Big Brother' controls every aspect of people's lives.",

A true work of genius, as well as my all-time favorite and least favorite novel (here I exercise doublethink) it's truly a masterpiece."},
          {"secondReview": "1984 is a grim tale telling us about the consequences that we may face if a totalitarian state happens to come in power and grew omnipotent. It is a terrifying read almost horror-like and thus also very effective on the minds of the reader. A lot of respect for George Orwell for establishing such a well-realized and detailed world, he truly is a visionary in that sense. It is a novel that everyone should read at least once!"},
          {"thirdReview": "This must be my all-time favorite book. It may be a hard read and is especially dense towards the middle but it is all worth it and shows how flawless a society like this could run. Written out of fear of socialism and totalitarianism it obviously has prevalent political messages that make the scenario terrifyingly possible. "}
